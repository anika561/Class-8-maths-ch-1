    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <h5>Fig. 1.1:</h5>

    <p>Integer, Whole-valued positive or negative number or 0. ... The integers are generated from the set of counting numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . and the operation of subtraction. When a counting number is subtracted from itself, the result is zero.An integer is a whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero. Therefore, the numbers 10, 0, -25, and 5,148 are all integers. Unlike floating point numbers, integers cannot have decimal places. Integers are a commonly used data type in computer programming.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Difference Between Numbers And Integers:</h3>
    <p>Natural numbers are all numbers 1, 2, 3, 4… ... Whole numbers are all natural numbers including 0 e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4… Integers include all whole numbers and their negative counterpart e.g. … -4, -3, -2, -1, 0,1, 2, 3, 4,…</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Addition of Integers:</h3>
    <p>When integers have the same sign, add the integers. The sum will have the same sign as the integers. When integers have different signs, find the difference between the two numbers. The sum will have the sign of the integer with the largest absolute value.</p>

    <h3>Subtraction of Integers:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, keep the first number (known as the minuend).</li>
        <li>Second, change the operation from subtraction to addition.</li>
        <li>Third, get the opposite sign of the second number (known as the subtrahend)</li>
        <li>Finally, proceed with the regular addition of integers.</li>

    <h3>Multiplication of Integers:</h3>
    <p><span> RULE 1:</span> The product of a positive integer and a negative integer is negative. <span>RULE 2:</span> The product of two positive integers is positive. <span>RULE 3:</span> The product of two negative integers is positive.</p>

    <h3>Division of Integers:</h3>
    <p><span>RULE 1:</span> The quotient of a positive integer and a negative integer is negative. <br> <span>RULE 2:</span> The quotient of two positive integers is positive. <br> <span>RULE 3:</span> The quotient of two negative integers is positive. If the signs are different the answer is negative.</p>
